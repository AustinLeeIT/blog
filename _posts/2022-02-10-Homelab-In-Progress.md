title: Working on updates to the home network

Check out the current state of my smartish home! We've got some Chromecast and Google Home devices as well as some cheap GE Cync smart bubls, Wyze wireless cameras, and a Honeywell smart . They all work well but each device brings its own concerns about security, privacy, and longevity. Using existing hardware and FOSS software, I have embarked to create a 'home cloud' of services that keep my data backed up, local, and ecnrypted. We'll get to see behind the scecnes as additional storage is attached and shared, so for now just take a look at the dozen or so services available at a click on my local network.

Here you can see the Homer page that can be quickly edited to include new services and links as needed. Many of the shortcuts link back to services running on the same Docker host as Homer itself. The few exceptions are mostly Raspberry Pi projects and configuration pages for other newtwork hardware. The printers (3D and traditional 2D) are wireless and each host their own web interface, meaining that they can be kept out the way in a closet or under a desk without having to sacrifice "always-on" convenience. I love being able to start a 3D print while laying in bed at night then waking up to finshed pieces in the moring, it's practically magic. Many of these links don't get clicked all that often thanks to Home Assistant providing a convenient, if incomplete, dashboard.
